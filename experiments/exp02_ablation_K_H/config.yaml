# Experiment 2: Ablation Study (K and H)
# K ablation and multi-hash ablation

D: 100352  # Small memory to force collisions (98 * 1024, divisible by block_size)
block_size: 1024  # Block size (power of 2, even n_bits)
d: 64
N: 5000   # Number of items to store

# Parameter sweeps
K_values: [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64]  # More points around transition
H_values: [1, 3]

# Test settings
test_size: 2000
batch_size: 5000
cosine_threshold: 0.9  # Threshold for accuracy calculation

# Reproducibility (multiple seeds for error bars)
seeds: [0, 1, 2]
seed: 42  # Kept for backward compatibility
